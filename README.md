# Duolingo Auto Continue

A simple browser extension that automatically continues to the next Duolingo exercise when it detects a green confirmation indicator.

## üîß Installation (Temporary)

Since this is not a published extension, you can install it temporarily using Firefox's debugging tools:

1. Open Firefox and go to `about:debugging`.  
2. Click on **"This Firefox"** in the left sidebar.  
3. Click **"Load Temporary Add-on"** and select the extension's `.xpi` file or a file inside the project folder (e.g., `manifest.json`).  
4. The extension will remain active until you restart Firefox. You will need to reload it each time you open the browser.

## üöÄ Usage

Once installed, the extension will automatically detect the green confirmation element and advance to the next exercise, making your Duolingo experience smoother.
